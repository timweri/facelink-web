      <p>Creatine Monohydrate: Most effective derivative of all creatines. Creatine enhances the bodies capacity to perform high intensity activity and assists in greater muscle size and performance gains as a result. Creatine Phosphate (creatines high energy molecule form, stored within the cells) is used to supply the type 11b muscle fibers (fast-twitch high-glycolytic; the muscles that get largest in size) with immediate energy, ensuring these muscles do not prematurely fatigue.</p>`
